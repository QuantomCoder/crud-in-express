# crud-in-express
I created a website to do crud using HTML CSS for front-end and Express JS for back-end 
# HTML CSS files
Start.html is my file to navigate to any crude opration you want to perfome
getToken.html is used to get tokens for the authentication of user.
read.html is used to get the details of user whose token you had entered
delete.html deletes the user using the token of the user
update.html is used to update the data of an existing coustomer 
create.html is used to add a new user/coustomer
# Beackend
for backend I used express jsonwebtoken and cors
I have given discriptive names to all Routes so anybody can understand that what my api is doing.
Thanks!
